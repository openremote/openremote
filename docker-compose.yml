# OpenRemote v3
#
# By default running this profile installs the stack on https://localhost using a
# self-signed SSL certificate, with username 'admin' and password 'secret'.
#
# Install Docker Community edition (https://docker.com/) on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
#
# Start a demo stack in the project root directory with:
#
#   docker-compose up
#
# For full documentation, see profile/deploy.yml
#
# Steps to create a permanent installation:
#
# 1. DO NOT FORGET TO CHANGE SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD!
#
# 2. Consider setting a custom DOMAINNAME, LE_EMAIL, and IDENTITY_NETWORK_HOST, see deploy.yml
#
# 3. Understand how bind mounts and volume mappings work, see below and read:
#     https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/
#     https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#choose-the--v-or-mount-flag
#     Survival guide: docker volume ls|rm|prune
#
# 4. Execute once:
#
#   SETUP_WIPE_CLEAN_INSTALL=true \
#   SETUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret \
#   docker-compose up
#
# This creates the initial database and optionally imports some examples. Inspect the
# running installation and ensure it's working. You should now stop the stack and remove
# all containers. It is important that you recreate the containers and start again WITHOUT
# the SETUP_WIPE_CLEAN_INSTALL setting! Passwords can be changed in the application.
#
# Database schemas will be upgraded to new versions of the services automatically, you do
# not have to wipe all data to install a new version of OpenRemote.
#
# Your extension JAR files should be in the deployment/manager/extensions/ directory.
#

# If you enable volume mappings in services, you need this. Otherwise, remove the volumes
