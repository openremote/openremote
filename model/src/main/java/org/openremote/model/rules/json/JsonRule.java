/**
 * A declarative rule definition a.k.a. JSON rules; consists of:
 * <p>
 * <h2>LHS</li>
 * <p>
 * {@link #when} - A series of grouped {@link RuleCondition}s to which bitwise operations can be performed based on the
 * {@link LogicGroup#operator} of each group. These are used to filter {@link org.openremote.model.attribute.AttributeInfo}s
 * in the RuleEngine that this rule is loaded into to determine which {@link org.openremote.model.asset.Asset}s match;
 * if one or more assets match then the RHS {@link #then} will be triggered. Once a rule is triggered the
 * {@link org.openremote.model.attribute.AttributeInfo}s that triggered the rule cannot trigger the rule again until it no longer
 * matches (within the context of the {@link RuleCondition} i.e. an {@link org.openremote.model.attribute.AttributeInfo} can
 * re-trigger a rule if it is matched by a different {@link RuleCondition})
 * <p>
 * The {@link #otherwise} {@link RuleAction}s are applied to the {@link org.openremote.model.asset.Asset}s filtered by
 * the query that don't match the {@link AssetQuery#attributes} predicates.
 * {@link #when} must evaluate to true and this condition must evaluate to true.
 * <h2>RHS</h2>
 * <p>
 * {@link #then} - Defines a series of {@link RuleAction}s to perform when the bitwise result of applying all
 * {@link RuleCondition}s in the {@link #when} is true.
 * <p>
 * {@link #otherwise} - Defines a series of {@link RuleAction}s to perform when there is one or more asset that matched  rule doesn't match the assets specified
 * in the {@link JsonRule#when}. The list of assets this applies to is the assets filtered by applying the
 * {@link JsonRule#when} but excluding the {@link AssetQuery#attributes} predicates and excluding any assets that match
 * the entire {@link JsonRule#when}. If the number of these assets is greater than 0 then these {@link RuleAction}s will be
 * executed.
