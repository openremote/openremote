/**
 * A protocol instance is responsible for connecting devices and services to the context broker. A protocol instance has
 * a one-to-one mapping with an {@link Agent} and should get its' configuration parameters from the {@link Attribute}s
 * of this {@link Agent}, how this is done is up to the {@link Agent}/{@link Protocol} creator to determine.
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * When the system is started or a CRUD operation is performed on an {@link Agent} then the following calls are made:
 * <h3>Destroy existing protocol instance</h3>
 * If a protocol instance already exists for the {@link Agent} then the following calls are made on that instance:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #unlinkAttribute} - Called for each attribute linked to the {@link Agent}</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h3>Create/initialise protocol instance</h3>
 * If the {@link Agent} was deleted or {@link Agent#isDisabled} then nothing happens otherwise:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #start} - If this call throws an exception then it is assumed that a permanent failure has occurred (i.e.
 *  the {@link Agent} is incorrectly configured) and this Agent's status will be marked as
 *  {@link ConnectionStatus#ERROR} and attribute linking will not occur.</li>
 * <li>{@link #linkAttribute} - Called for each attribute linked to the {@link Agent}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h3>Configuring protocol instances</h3>
 * Each {@link Agent} asset has its' own {@link Protocol} instance and this instance is responsible for managing only
 * the attributes linked to that specific instance, it is up to the specific {@link Agent} type to initialise an
 * instance of its' own {@link Protocol}.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Connecting attributes to actuators and sensors</h3>
 * {@link Attribute}s of {@link Asset}s can be linked to a protocol instance by creating an {@link
 * MetaItemType#AGENT_LINK} {@link MetaItem} on an attribute. Besides the {@link MetaItemType#AGENT_LINK}, other
 * protocol-specific meta items may also be required when an asset attribute is linked to a protocol
 * instance. Attributes linked to a protocol instance will get passed to the protocol via a call to {@link
 * #linkAttribute}.
 * <p>
 * The protocol handles read and write of linked attributes:
 * <p>
 * If the actual state of the device (or service) changes, the linked protocol writes the new state into the attribute
 * value and notifies the context broker of the change. A protocol updates a linked attributes' value by sending  an
 * {@link AttributeEvent} messages on the {@link #SENSOR_QUEUE}, including the source protocol name in header {@link
 * #SENSOR_QUEUE_SOURCE_PROTOCOL}.
 * <p>
 * If the user writes a new value into the linked attribute, the protocol translates this value change into a device (or
 * service) action. Write operations on attributes linked to an {@link Agent} can be consumed by the agent's protocol on
 * the {@link #ACTUATOR_TOPIC} where the message body will be an {@link AttributeEvent}. Each message also contains the
 * target protocol name in header {@link #ACTUATOR_TOPIC_TARGET_PROTOCOL}.
 * <p>
 * To simplify protocol development some common protocol behaviour is recommended for generic protocols:
 * <h1>Inbound value conversion (Protocol -> Linked Attribute)</h1>
 * <p>
 * Standard value filtering and/or conversion should be performed in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Configurable value filtering which allows the value produced by the protocol to be filtered through any
 * number of {@link ValueFilter}s before being written to the linked attribute
 * (see {@link AgentLink#getValueFilters})</li>
 * <li>Configurable value conversion which allows the value produced by the protocol to be converted in a configurable
 * way before being written to the linked attribute (see {@link AgentLink#getValueConverter})</li>
 * <li>Automatic basic value conversion should be performed when the type of the value produced by the
 * protocol and any configured value conversion does not match the linked attributes underlying value type; this
 * basic conversion should use the {@link ValueUtil#convert} method</li>
 * </ol>
 * <h1>Outbound value conversion (Linked Attribute -> Protocol)</h1>
 * Standard value conversion should be performed in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Configurable value conversion which allows the value sent from the linked attribute to be converted in a
 * configurable way before being sent to the protocol for processing (see {@link AgentLink#getWriteValueConverter})
 * <li>Configurable dynamic value insertion (replacement of {@link #DYNAMIC_VALUE_PLACEHOLDER} strings within a
 * pre-defined JSON string with the value sent from the linked attribute (this allows for attribute values to be inserted
 * into a larger payload before processing by the protocol; it also allows the written value to be fixed or statically
 * converted (see {@link AgentLink#getWriteValue}).
 * </ol>
 * When sending the converted value onto the actual protocol implementation for processing the original
 * {@link AttributeEvent} as well as the converted value should be made available.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: That {@link #start} will always be called
 * before {@link #linkAttribute} and {@link #unlinkAttribute} will always be called before
 * {@link #stop}.
 * <p>
 * The following summarises the method calls protocols should expect:
 * <p>
 * {@link Agent} asset is created/loaded:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #start}</li>
 * <li>{@link #linkAttribute}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * {@link Agent} is modified:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #unlinkAttribute}</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop}</li>
 * <li>{@link #start}</li>
 * <li>{@link #linkAttribute}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * {@link Agent} is removed:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #unlinkAttribute}</li>
 * <li>{@link #stop}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Attribute linked to {@link Agent} is created/loaded:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #linkAttribute}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Attribute linked to {@link Agent} is modified:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #unlinkAttribute}</li>
 * <li>{@link #linkAttribute}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Attribute link to {@link Agent} is removed:
 * <ol>
 * <li>{@link #unlinkAttribute}</li>
 * </ol>
