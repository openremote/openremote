# OpenRemote v3
#
# Profile that runs the vanilla stack on https://localhost using a self-signed SSL certificate,
# with username 'admin' and password 'secret' using the basic identity provider (i.e. no keycloak
# for constrained devices such as edge gateways). There is no map data available in the vanilla
# system so the map tile server will not function. Persistent data is stored in a docker
# volume called postgresql-data between restarts, simply delete this volume to reset the
# system to an empty state.
#
# Please see deploy.yml for configuration details for each service.
