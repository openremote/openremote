# Load Tests

Deploy load2 with `test/or-eks-load`, which selects its profile and calls
`kubernetes/or-eks-cluster` and `kubernetes/or-eks-stack`.
Create a dedicated cluster or deploy independently into an existing compatible
cluster. Each stack has its own namespace, credentials, storage, and endpoints.
Run the commands below from the **repository root**.

Profiles select the node size and per-component CPU/memory budgets:

- large: minimal set-up useful to test memory leaks and pressure condition
- xlarge-minimal: gives Manager 2Gi more memory than large (3840Mi vs 1792Mi), with room for further increases
- xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 4 CPU/16 GB cluster
- 2xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 8 CPU/32 GB cluster
- 4xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 16 CPU/64 GB cluster
- 8xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 32 CPU/128 GB cluster

Select a profile through `LOAD_PROFILE` in the deployment config. Each directory contains an
`or-eks-cluster --config` template and the four shared component values files:
`manager.yaml`, `postgresql.yaml`, `keycloak.yaml`, and `proxy.yaml`. Both the
CLI workflow and the legacy ACM/NLB scripts use these files.
All profiles provision a 32 GiB Manager PVC and a 256 GiB PostgreSQL PVC,
preserving the intended sizes from the old provisioning configuration. The old
per-chart `volumeSize: 16Gi` keys were no longer consumed by the charts.

The `large` and `xlarge-minimal` profiles now use 768Mi for Keycloak.
The old 512Mi allocation caused Keycloak 26 to be OOMKilled
during initial setup.
If Manager has already created its schema when Keycloak fails, a subsequent
Manager restart can skip setup (`clean install = false`) even though the
`openremote` client and test dataset were never initialized. Stabilize Keycloak
before deliberately resetting and rebuilding that incomplete test dataset.

This folder contains a different setup than load1 and includes different test scenarios.

The setup is controlled by the following parameters:

- OR_SETUP_USERS: the number of accounts to create
- OR_SETUP_ASSETS: the number of light assets to create in each account
- OR_SETUP_ASSETS_WITH_LOCATIONS: number of assets (per account) that will be assigned a location
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CLUSTERS: number of clusters to divide location-enabled assets into
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_MAIN_CENTER: main center point in "lon,lat" format (e.g. "4.470175,51.923464")
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CENTER_DISTANCE: distance in meters between cluster centers
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_ASSET_RADIUS: max radius in meters for random asset locations around each cluster center

The setup creates:

- OR_SETUP_USERS standard user account
- In each account, 1 Building asset
- As child of each Building asset, OR_SETUP_ASSETS Light assets
- OR_SETUP_ASSETS_WITH_LOCATIONS of those Light assets will have a location set.  
  All locations are distributed in OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CLUSTERS clusters.  
  The clusters' centers are arranged in a hex grid pattern around OR_SETUP_LOCATION_MAIN_CENTER.  
  Within each cluster, the locations are random within a OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CENTER_DISTANCE radius from the cluster center.
- OR_SETUP_USERS restricted service users, linked to the corresponding Building asset,
  with appropriate permission to push attribute values

## Creating the load test Manager image

Build and push the custom Manager image from the repository root using the
checkout you want to test. All profiles use the custom `load2` tag, so upgrading
the Manager chart's `appVersion` does not upgrade this image. Rebuild and push
it for each Manager version you want to test:

```
./gradlew -PSETUP_JAR=load2 clean installDist

# The Manager Dockerfile copies lib, but not deployment/manager/extensions.
# Include the custom setup JAR on the image's application classpath.
cp manager/build/install/manager/deployment/manager/extensions/openremote-load2-setup-*.jar \
    manager/build/install/manager/lib/

export AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID="dev-account-id"
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t $AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/openremote/manager:load2 manager/build/install/manager/
```

All profiles use `image.pullPolicy: Always` so new Manager Pods pull the current
`load2` image. Pushing the tag does not restart existing Pods. Keycloak and
PostgreSQL use the image versions in their Kubernetes charts.

The JAR copy above is required: without it, the image can initialize Keycloak
and allow login, but the custom load-test setup provider is absent and no test
users or assets are created. During a clean initialization, Manager logs should
identify `org.openremote.setup.load2.SetupTasks` as a custom setup provider.

## Deploy the cluster and stack

Copy the example configuration and edit its hostname, image repository, and
AWS profile settings:

```bash
mkdir -p .local
cp test/load2-eks/deployment.env.example .local/loadtest.env
```

Then deploy and retrieve credentials:

```bash
test/or-eks-load up --config .local/loadtest.env
test/or-eks-load credentials --config .local/loadtest.env
```

The [shared deployment guide](../README-eks-load.md) explains prerequisites,
configuration, verification, and cleanup. The Bash helper discovers the DNS
zone, configures the cluster's DNS role, and prepares component values
automatically. Use `cluster-up` and `deploy` separately when managing an
existing cluster. Selecting another profile does not resize existing nodes.

## Switching an existing Deployment to Recreate

The Keycloak and Manager charts support an optional deployment strategy. To
avoid needing spare capacity for overlapping old and new Pods during an
upgrade, set this in the values file for each chart that should use it:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: Recreate
```

With `Recreate`, a rollout terminates the old Pods before starting their
replacements, so upgrades interrupt service. The chart default, `strategy: {}`,
leaves Kubernetes to use its default `RollingUpdate` strategy on a fresh install.

When changing an existing Deployment from `RollingUpdate` to `Recreate`, its
`spec.strategy.rollingUpdate` settings must also be removed. Kubernetes rejects
a Deployment that has both `type: Recreate` and a `rollingUpdate` block. The
templates render `rollingUpdate: null` to clear that block, but if an upgrade
(including one using server-side apply) retains the existing settings, it can
fail with:

```text
spec.strategy.rollingUpdate: Forbidden: may not be specified when strategy `type` is 'Recreate'
```

For this error, use a JSON merge patch to set the strategy and remove the
incompatible block in the same request, then retry the upgrade. A merge patch
updates the specified fields while preserving omitted fields; a `null` value
removes a field. Unlike server-side apply, it explicitly patches the live object
without relying on apply's field ownership to remove previously managed settings.

Set `K_CONTEXT` to the target cluster context and `K_NAMESPACE` to the namespace
containing the release. The examples use the Deployment names created by the
load-test scripts; adjust them if you use different release names or name overrides.
Run only the patch for each Deployment you intend to switch:

```shell
kubectl --context "$K_CONTEXT" --namespace "$K_NAMESPACE" patch deployment keycloak \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"type":"Recreate","rollingUpdate":null}}}'

kubectl --context "$K_CONTEXT" --namespace "$K_NAMESPACE" patch deployment manager \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"type":"Recreate","rollingUpdate":null}}}'
```

Keep `strategy.type: Recreate` in the Helm values used for subsequent upgrades.
This workaround is only needed if the strategy change fails to remove the old
settings. Fresh installations using `Recreate` and upgrades that keep `Recreate`
do not need it. A Deployment created after this chart option was introduced can
still encounter the issue if it starts with `RollingUpdate` and switches later.

See the Kubernetes documentation on [patching API objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/)
and [server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/).

## Running tests

Before starting a load run, verify browser login, asset creation/editing, and
an authenticated MQTTS publish using a provisioned test account. On clean
startup, Manager logs should identify `org.openremote.setup.load2.SetupTasks`.

Once deployed, running the load tests can be done using the same clients as for load testing a VM,
but using the scenarios present under `scenarios` in this folder instead.  
See `load1` folder for the tools, scripts and documentation.

Two scenarios are provided:

#### connect-and-publish

Runs for a given duration, publishing attribute value changes over MQTT once connected.  
For each connection, it publishes ASSETS_COUNT values at the same time (50ms interval), then pauses for MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES.  
If a publish fails because the connection is lost and `RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` is greater than 0, the thread returns to the connect step and retries only while its original per-thread runtime has not yet elapsed. If `RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` is 0, the thread does not retry and its load is lost.  
At the end of publish loop, it waits for DISCONNECT_DELAY before disconnecting from MQTT.

The parameters are:  
MANAGER_HOSTNAME: Hostname of the manager to be tested. Default is 127.0.0.1.  
THREAD_COUNT: Number of parallel accounts that will connect and publish in parallel. Default is 500.  
ASSETS_COUNT: Number of Light assets for which to publish an attribute during each iteration. Default is 5.  
RAMP_RATE: Number of thread to add per second during ramp-up. Default is 20.  
DURATION: Total duration to run the test for, in seconds. Default is 300.  
MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES: Delay between each publishing iteration. Default is 1000.  
RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS: Reconnect control. Default is 0. With the current HiveMQ-based xmeter client, 0 disables automatic reconnect and any positive value enables it using the client's default reconnect configuration. The scenario also uses this setting to control JMeter-level retry behavior: 0 means no reconnect retry loop, any positive value means failed publish loops return to the connect step and retry only until the original per-thread runtime expires, even if connect attempts keep timing out.  
DISCONNECT_DELAY: Delay before closing the MQTT connection after publishing loop, in seconds. Default is 0.

#### connect-settle-test

Connects up to THREAD_COUNT accounts to the system.  
Once connected, it does 1 single publish every MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES (defaults to 300s).  
Goal is to measure the time it takes for the system to allow that many connections and stabilise.

The parameters are:  
MANAGER_HOSTNAME: Hostname of the manager to be tested. Default is 127.0.0.1.  
THREAD_COUNT: Number of parallel accounts that will connect and publish in parallel. Default is 1000.  
RAMP_RATE: Number of thread to add per second during ramp-up. Default is 50.  
MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES: Delay between each publishing iteration. Default is 30000.

## Legacy ACM/NLB multi-proxy experiment

The experiment from [issue #2568](https://github.com/openremote/openremote/issues/2568)
remains deployable with `eks-setup-load-acm.sh`. It terminates both HTTPS and
MQTTS at one public ACM-backed NLB and forwards plaintext to HAProxy. It reads
the same component values in `profiles/$OR_PROFILE` as the CLI workflow, then
layers `values-proxy-acm-load.yaml` over `proxy.yaml` for the experimental
topology. The legacy scripts pass the Manager image repository through
`--set-string image.repository`, replacing the template placeholder without a
separate rendering step.

Use a **dedicated disposable cluster** for this single-stack, default-namespace
workflow. Do not mix it with CLI-managed stacks. Unlike the CLI workflow, its
helper still configures local `or`/`dnschg` AWS profiles and uses the historical
Route 53 role/hosted-zone configuration: review `eks-common.sh` and the DNS zone
IDs in setup/cleanup before use. Its defaults now use `load2-legacy-cluster`
and `load2-legacy.openremote.app` to distinguish it from the CLI examples.

After building/pushing the load2 Manager image, and ensuring the private proxy
repository contains the proxy chart's image version, run from this directory:

```bash
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="cluster-account-id"
export AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID="dev-account-id"
export CLUSTER_NAME=load2-legacy-cluster
export AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
export FQDN=load2-legacy.openremote.app
export OR_PROFILE=large
export K_CONTEXT="$CLUSTER_NAME@$AWS_REGION"
bash ./eks-setup-load-acm.sh
```

For multiple proxies, set `replicaCount` in `values-proxy-acm-load.yaml` before
deployment so it applies only to this experiment. Each replica receives that
profile's full resource budget; increase node capacity accordingly. This mode
has no proxy PVC or ACME state. Its compatibility updates explicitly enable
MQTTS and use the current component-owned PVCs (32 GiB Manager, 256 GiB
PostgreSQL by default, configured through `persistence.size` in the selected
profile's `manager.yaml` and `postgresql.yaml`) with the `openremote-ebs`
StorageClass. Resource budgets, setup parameters, and update strategies also
come from the shared profile files.

The duplicate `values-*-eks-load.yaml` files and the old
`values-or-setup-eks-load.yaml` sizing file have been removed. Transfer any local
customizations to the corresponding shared component file; use
`values-proxy-acm-load.yaml` for experiment-specific proxy settings. Set
`LOAD_VALUES_DIR` in the deployment config to keep using prepared component
values with the helper.

The script prints the command for retrieving the generated administrator
password. Use `$FQDN` for browser access and the scenarios' `MANAGER_HOSTNAME`.

For the legacy dataset rebuild, keep the proxy running and run
`bash ./eks-deploy-load.sh` with the same environment. **This sets
`or.setupRunOnRestart=true` and resets the database on every Manager restart.**
After setup completes, disable it while preserving the deployed values:

```bash
helm upgrade manager ../../kubernetes/manager \
  --kube-context "$K_CONTEXT" --namespace default --reuse-values \
  --set or.setupRunOnRestart=false --wait --timeout 90m
```

Use `bash ./eks-cleanup-load.sh` with the same configuration to remove the
legacy deployment and its dedicated cluster. It refuses clusters with
CLI-managed namespaces. It retains the old experiment's ACM certificate and
validation CNAME; inspect and remove those separately when no longer needed.
For installations made before the PVC migration, also inspect their manually
created EBS volumes/static PVs separately.

For a new CLI-managed ACM deployment, the shared guide documents the Ingress
alternative: a shared web ALB plus a separate per-stack MQTTS NLB/hostname.
That is a different topology and should be recorded when comparing load results.
