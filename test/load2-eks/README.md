# Load Tests

Scripts and configuration files to setup an OpenRemote stack running in an EKS cluster appropriate for load testing.
This includes configuring the cluster to use a more powerful machine
and adapting the values files to configure the memory usage on the different pods.  
For the manager, JVM parameters are used to make use of the extra memory available to the container.  
There are different "profiles" available depending on the power required and the tests to be run:

- large: minimal set-up useful to test memory leaks and pressure condition
- xlarge-minimal: gives Manager 2Gi more memory than large (3840Mi vs 1792Mi), with room for further increases
- xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 4 CPU/16 GB cluster
- 2xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 8 CPU/32 GB cluster
- 4xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 16 CPU/64 GB cluster
- 8xlarge: bigger setup using all capacity on 32 CPU/128 GB cluster

The profile is selected by setting the OR_PROFILE environment variable in the `eks-common.sh` script.

The `large` and `xlarge-minimal` profiles now use 768Mi for Keycloak.
The old 512Mi allocation caused Keycloak 26 to be OOMKilled
during initial setup.
If Manager has already created its schema when Keycloak fails, a subsequent
Manager restart can skip setup (`clean install = false`) even though the
`openremote` client and test dataset were never initialized. Stabilize Keycloak
before deliberately resetting and rebuilding that incomplete test dataset.

This folder contains a different setup than load1 and includes different test scenarios.

The setup is controlled by the following parameters:

- OR_SETUP_USERS: the number of accounts to create
- OR_SETUP_ASSETS: the number of light assets to create in each account
- OR_SETUP_ASSETS_WITH_LOCATIONS: number of assets (per account) that will be assigned a location
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CLUSTERS: number of clusters to divide location-enabled assets into
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_MAIN_CENTER: main center point in "lon,lat" format (e.g. "4.470175,51.923464")
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CENTER_DISTANCE: distance in meters between cluster centers
- OR_SETUP_LOCATION_ASSET_RADIUS: max radius in meters for random asset locations around each cluster center

The setup creates:

- OR_SETUP_USERS standard user account
- In each account, 1 Building asset
- As child of each Building asset, OR_SETUP_ASSETS Light assets
- OR_SETUP_ASSETS_WITH_LOCATIONS of those Light assets will have a location set.  
  All locations are distributed in OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CLUSTERS clusters.  
  The clusters' centers are arranged in a hex grid pattern around OR_SETUP_LOCATION_MAIN_CENTER.  
  Within each cluster, the locations are random within a OR_SETUP_LOCATION_CENTER_DISTANCE radius from the cluster center.
- OR_SETUP_USERS restricted service users, linked to the corresponding Building asset,
  with appropriate permission to push attribute values

Build and push the custom Manager image from the repository root using the
checkout you want to test. All profiles use the custom `load2` tag, so upgrading
the Manager chart's `appVersion` does not upgrade this image. Rebuild and push
it for each Manager version you want to test:

```
./gradlew -PSETUP_JAR=load2 clean installDist

# The Manager Dockerfile copies lib, but not deployment/manager/extensions.
# Include the custom setup JAR on the image's application classpath.
cp manager/build/install/manager/deployment/manager/extensions/openremote-load2-setup-*.jar \
    manager/build/install/manager/lib/

export AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID="dev-account-id"
aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin $AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t $AWS_DEVELOPERS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/openremote/manager:load2 manager/build/install/manager/
```

All profiles use `image.pullPolicy: Always` so new Manager Pods pull the current
`load2` image. Pushing the tag does not restart existing Pods. Keycloak and
PostgreSQL use the image versions in their Kubernetes charts.

The JAR copy above is required: without it, the image can initialize Keycloak
and allow login, but the custom load-test setup provider is absent and no test
users or assets are created. During a clean initialization, Manager logs should
identify `org.openremote.setup.load2.SetupTasks` as a custom setup provider.

You might want to update the stack without re-creating the whole cluster, as re-creating the cluster takes time and
requires re-generating a new certificate (on which we have some limits).  
To do so, keep the proxy running and uninstall the other charts

```shell
helm uninstall manager postgresql keycloak
```

then use the `eks-deploy-load.sh` script to properly re-deploy those charts.
That script sets `or.setupRunOnRestart=true` to reset and rebuild the test
dataset; this procedure does not preserve your existing test data.

## Switching an existing Deployment to Recreate

The Keycloak and Manager charts support an optional deployment strategy. To
avoid needing spare capacity for overlapping old and new Pods during an
upgrade, set this in the values file for each chart that should use it:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: Recreate
```

With `Recreate`, a rollout terminates the old Pods before starting their
replacements, so upgrades interrupt service. The chart default, `strategy: {}`,
leaves Kubernetes to use its default `RollingUpdate` strategy on a fresh install.

When changing an existing Deployment from `RollingUpdate` to `Recreate`, its
`spec.strategy.rollingUpdate` settings must also be removed. Kubernetes rejects
a Deployment that has both `type: Recreate` and a `rollingUpdate` block. The
templates render `rollingUpdate: null` to clear that block, but if an upgrade
(including one using server-side apply) retains the existing settings, it can
fail with:

```text
spec.strategy.rollingUpdate: Forbidden: may not be specified when strategy `type` is 'Recreate'
```

For this error, use a JSON merge patch to set the strategy and remove the
incompatible block in the same request, then retry the upgrade. A merge patch
updates the specified fields while preserving omitted fields; a `null` value
removes a field. Unlike server-side apply, it explicitly patches the live object
without relying on apply's field ownership to remove previously managed settings.

Set `K_CONTEXT` to the target cluster context and `K_NAMESPACE` to the namespace
containing the release. The examples use the Deployment names created by the
load-test scripts; adjust them if you use different release names or name overrides.
Run only the patch for each Deployment you intend to switch:

```shell
kubectl --context "$K_CONTEXT" --namespace "$K_NAMESPACE" patch deployment keycloak \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"type":"Recreate","rollingUpdate":null}}}'

kubectl --context "$K_CONTEXT" --namespace "$K_NAMESPACE" patch deployment manager \
  --type=merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"strategy":{"type":"Recreate","rollingUpdate":null}}}'
```

Keep `strategy.type: Recreate` in the Helm values used for subsequent upgrades.
This workaround is only needed if the strategy change fails to remove the old
settings. Fresh installations using `Recreate` and upgrades that keep `Recreate`
do not need it. A Deployment created after this chart option was introduced can
still encounter the issue if it starts with `RollingUpdate` and switches later.

See the Kubernetes documentation on [patching API objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/)
and [server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/).

## Running load tests

Once deployed, running the load tests can be done using the same clients as for load testing a VM,
but using the scenarios present under `scenarios` in this folder instead.  
See `load1` folder for the tools, scripts and documentation.

Two scenarios are provided:

#### connect-and-publish

Runs for a given duration, publishing attribute value changes over MQTT once connected.  
For each connection, it publishes ASSETS_COUNT values at the same time (50ms interval), then pauses for MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES.  
If a publish fails because the connection is lost and `RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` is greater than 0, the thread returns to the connect step and retries only while its original per-thread runtime has not yet elapsed. If `RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS` is 0, the thread does not retry and its load is lost.  
At the end of publish loop, it waits for DISCONNECT_DELAY before disconnecting from MQTT.

The parameters are:  
MANAGER_HOSTNAME: Hostname of the manager to be tested. Default is 127.0.0.1.  
THREAD_COUNT: Number of parallel accounts that will connect and publish in parallel. Default is 500.  
ASSETS_COUNT: Number of Light assets for which to publish an attribute during each iteration. Default is 5.  
RAMP_RATE: Number of thread to add per second during ramp-up. Default is 20.  
DURATION: Total duration to run the test for, in seconds. Default is 300.  
MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES: Delay between each publishing iteration. Default is 1000.  
RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS: Reconnect control. Default is 0. With the current HiveMQ-based xmeter client, 0 disables automatic reconnect and any positive value enables it using the client's default reconnect configuration. The scenario also uses this setting to control JMeter-level retry behavior: 0 means no reconnect retry loop, any positive value means failed publish loops return to the connect step and retry only until the original per-thread runtime expires, even if connect attempts keep timing out.  
DISCONNECT_DELAY: Delay before closing the MQTT connection after publishing loop, in seconds. Default is 0.

#### connect-settle-test

Connects up to THREAD_COUNT accounts to the system.  
Once connected, it does 1 single publish every MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES (defaults to 300s).  
Goal is to measure the time it takes for the system to allow that many connections and stabilise.

The parameters are:  
MANAGER_HOSTNAME: Hostname of the manager to be tested. Default is 127.0.0.1.  
THREAD_COUNT: Number of parallel accounts that will connect and publish in parallel. Default is 1000.  
RAMP_RATE: Number of thread to add per second during ramp-up. Default is 50.  
MILLIS_BETWEEN_PUBLISHES: Delay between each publishing iteration. Default is 30000.

## Multi-proxy test

As part of [Test using multiple HAProxy replicas under EKS · Issue #2568 · openremote/core](https://github.com/openremote/core/issues/2568),
a setup terminating TLS at the AWS NLB level and using ACM to manage certificates, while still using HAProxy pod(s) has been implemented.  
This can be installed using the `eks-setup-load-acm.sh` script.  
This is really for testing purposes and clarification on how we deploy our stack is required to move further.
