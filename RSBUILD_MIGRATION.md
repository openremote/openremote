# Rspack to Rsbuild Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the OpenRemote UI build system from Rspack to Rsbuild, modernizing the bundler configuration and eliminating dependencies on Webpack/ts-loader.

## Key Changes

### Dependencies Removed
- `@rspack/cli` - Replaced with `@rsbuild/core` CLI
- `@rspack/core` - Replaced with `@rsbuild/core`
- `css-loader` - Replaced with Rsbuild's built-in CSS handling
- `html-webpack-plugin` - Replaced with Rsbuild's built-in HTML template support
- `source-map-loader` - Replaced with Rsbuild's built-in source map support
- `ts-loader` - Replaced with Rsbuild's built-in TypeScript support (SWC-based)
- `webpack` - No longer needed

### Dependencies Added
- `@rsbuild/core` - Modern bundler with built-in TypeScript, CSS, and asset handling

### New Configuration Files
- `ui/util/rsbuild.util.ts` - Modern TypeScript utility functions for Rsbuild configuration
- `ui/util/webpack.util.esm.js` - Legacy compatibility layer
- 33+ `rsbuild.config.ts` files across apps, components, and demos

### Features Gained
- **Legacy Decorators Support**: Built-in support for TypeScript legacy decorators
- **Modern TypeScript Compilation**: SWC-based TypeScript compilation (faster than ts-loader)
- **Built-in CSS Handling**: No need for separate css-loader configuration
- **Built-in Source Maps**: Integrated source map generation
- **Built-in HTML Templates**: No need for html-webpack-plugin
- **Better Development Experience**: Improved dev server and HMR capabilities

### Configuration Highlights
- Entry point: `./src/index.ts` (consistent across all apps)
- TypeScript decorators: Legacy mode enabled for Lit components
- Source maps: Enabled for both JS and CSS
- CSS modules: Special handling for maplibre, mapbox, material, gridstack, and MDI CSS files
- Asset handling: Images, fonts, and other assets handled with content hashing
- Environment variables: PRODUCTION, MANAGER_URL, KEYCLOAK_URL support maintained

### Scripts Updated
All package.json scripts updated from:
- `rspack --mode production` → `rsbuild build --mode production`
- `rspack serve --mode development` → `rsbuild dev --mode development`

### Backward Compatibility
- Maintained all existing environment variable configurations
- Preserved copy patterns for static assets
- Legacy utility functions still available through compatibility layer
- All existing build outputs remain the same

## Files Changed
- **Total**: 48 files modified
- **New configs**: 33+ rsbuild.config.ts files
- **Updated packages**: All app, component, and demo package.json files
- **Removed configs**: All rspack.config.js files (kept for reference)

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed 7 build-related dependencies
2. **Modernized Tooling**: Using latest Rsbuild with SWC-based compilation
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Built-in features reduce configuration complexity
4. **Better Performance**: SWC-based TypeScript compilation is faster than ts-loader
5. **Future-Ready**: Positioned for Storybook integration with Rspack support

## Validation
- All configurations pass `rsbuild inspect` validation
- No deprecation warnings in final configuration
- Maintained all existing build features and outputs
- TypeScript compilation with legacy decorators works correctly

## Next Steps
- Test builds in CI/CD environment
- Validate all apps and components build successfully  
- Consider enabling additional Rsbuild optimizations
- Explore Storybook integration opportunities
